# QuSim
This is an (incomplete) implementation of a quantum score editor, similar to IBM's quantum experience. The ultimate goal of this Python module is to allow for the design of quantum circuits using only Clifford and pi/8 gates (the so-called "universal set"). An implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm was also previously attempted (but, needless to say, failed miserably).
